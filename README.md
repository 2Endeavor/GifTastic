The theme of this gif grabber is superheroes. 

This program starts with a row of five buttons, each with a different name of a superhero. When clicked, 15 Gif are displayed on the screen. Each time the user clicks a new button, the images are cleared, and the new images are populated.

In addition to the five buttons that are programed in, the user can create their own buttons by clicking on the button, “Add a Hero”. Once clicked, images of the hero referenced are displayed and a new button for the hero is created.

Originally I had a button the user was required to use to enter new hero names. As a user, I hated the button because I naturally wanted to hit the enter key to submit the new name. I decided to get rid of the button and now the user's fingers can stay on the keyboard.

I had a lot of fun playing with this program and the Gifs!
