The theme of this gif grabber is superheroes. 

This program starts with a row of five buttons, each with a different name of a superhero. When clicked, 15 Gif are displayed on the screen. Each time the user clicks a new button, the images are cleared, and the new images are populated.

In addition to the five buttons that are programed in, the user can create their ow buttons by clicking on the button, “Add a Hero”. Once clicked, images of the hero referenced are displayed a new button for that hero is displayed.

When entering the hero’s name, the user can enter the data by either clicking the Add a Hero button or pressing the enter key.

Bugs to fix and styling to improve:
1.	Blank buttons appear when no text is entered
2.	Duplicate buttons are created if user types a character’s name more than once

3.	The letters on the hero buttons should be all upper-case

I had a lot of fun playing with this program and the Gifs!
